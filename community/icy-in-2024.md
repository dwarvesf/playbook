Follow up on our recent post [[df-protocol-icy-dfg|df protocol, $icy and $dfg]].
Since 2020, $icy has been a part of our workflow. Here's a quick recap.

- 2020: we introduced ICY as our first community experiment.
- 2021: we launched [icy.so](https://icy.so), a site to redeem $icy.
- 2022: $icy became our primary reward method, starting with summit-2022 and doty where we sent out about $20000
- 2023: we introduced `vault` as a reward avenue for our functional team.

and we have more exciting things on the horizon:

- Salary advance: a short-term credit benefit for full-time peeps.
- Discord utility commands for $icy-related activity.
- Direct withdrawal of $icy to your bank account.
- $icy store
- ... and staking $icy.

all plan are set: now, it's team to sit down and code. if you'd like to lend us a hand while earning some juicy bounty rewards, please reach out to @hnh in Discord.
