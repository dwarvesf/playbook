As you may know, Dwarves Discord network is where we connect with our friends, alumni, and like-minded people.

Bounties are rewards (in ICY - Dwarves’ token) given out to community members for work that encourages community developers to get more involved in the development outside of their core skills.

## <span style='color:red'>**Who can join**</span>
We offer a platform for those seeking development work and a dynamic environment to connect with skilled developers capable of building new tools, new features.

* It is open to anyone who has the required skills and knowledge.
* Bounties commonly require skills such as writing, design, research, development, and finance.
