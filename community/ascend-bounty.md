**Possible app name**
* Progress
* Ascend

It sounds like a fun and engaging way to encourage group participation and goal achievement using blockchain technology. Here are a few thoughts and potential features to consider as you build your on-chain tool:

### Smart Contract Functionality
* Goal Creation: The host creates a smart contract on the blockchain specifying the goal details (description,milestones, duration, commitment amounts, etc.).
* Member Joining & Committing: Members join the contract by sending their commitment amount in cryptocurrency. This triggers a "joining" event in the contract
* Milestone Tracking
  * The contract could automatically track the completion of milestones, perhaps by integrating with other apps or data sources (e.g., fitness trackers for health goals, project management tools for work goals).
  * Or, members could manually attest to milestone completion (with some kind of verification mechanism to prevent cheating).
* Reward Distribution:
  * Upon successful completion of all milestones, the smart contract automatically distributes the prize pool among the remaining members.
  * The distribution could be equal shares or proportional to the initial commitment amounts.

* Penalty Enforcement:
  * If a member misses milestones and gets "kicked out," their commitment amount is forfeited and redistributed among the remaining members.
  * You'll need to define clear rules about how many missed milestones trigger a kick-out.

**Additional Features**:
* Tokenization: Consider creating a governance token for the platform. This would allow users to vote on features,changes, and perhaps even the distribution of rewards in some cases.
* Social Interaction: Incorporate features for group chat, progress updates, and encouragement to foster a sense of community.
* Gamification: Add elements of competition or rewards for consistent participation to make it more engaging.
* Flexible Goal Types: Expand beyond just financial commitments. Allow for goals related to health, learning, skill development, etc.

## Bounty Ideas
1. Health and Wellness
* Fitness Challenges: Groups commit to workout routines, step goals, or weight loss targets. Smart contracts could integrate with fitness trackers to verify progress.
* Habit Formation: Groups encourage each other to build healthy habits like meditation, journaling, or healthy eating. Members could attest to completing daily/weekly tasks.
* Mental Health Support: Groups focused on managing anxiety, depression, or stress could create goals around therapy attendance, journaling, or mindfulness exercises.

2. Education and Skill Development
* Study Groups: Students form groups to prepare for exams or work on projects together, with incentives for collective success.
* Language Learning: Groups committed to learning a new language could set milestones for vocabulary acquisition or fluency levels.

3. Professional and Creative Fields
* Project Collaboration: Teams working on projects could set milestones and commit funds to incentivize timely completion and high-quality deliverables.
* Creative Challenges: Groups of artists, writers, or musicians could create challenges with specific goals (e.g.,writing a certain number of words, composing a piece of music) and reward the most successful participants.
* Networking and Mentorship: Groups focused on professional development could set goals around attending networking events, completing certifications, or finding mentors.

4. Social Impact and Community Building
* Charity and Fundraising: Groups could commit to raising a certain amount of money for a cause, with rewards for achieving milestones or exceeding the goal.
* Volunteer Work: Groups could set goals for volunteering hours or completing specific community service tasks,with rewards for collective achievement.
* Environmental Initiatives: Groups focused on sustainability could commit to reducing waste, conserving energy, or promoting eco-friendly practices.

5. Personal Finance and Investing
* Savings Challenges: Groups commit to saving a certain amount of money over a period, with rewards for achieving milestones or reaching the goal.
* Investment Clubs: Groups pool funds to invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies, or other assets, with smart contracts automating profit sharing or loss mitigation.

**Additional Considerations**:
* Industry-Specific Verification: Tailor verification mechanisms to the specific industry. For example, fitness goals might require integration with wearables, while education goals might require quiz/assignment results.
* Privacy and Data Protection: Be mindful of sensitive data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations,especially in healthcare and financial industries.
* Customization and Flexibility: Allow for customization of goal types, milestones, rewards, and verification methods to cater to the unique needs of different industries.
