Welcome to Dwarves Network,

We've grown a lot since launching our Discord server since the first day we made this network grow based on developers-centric.

That’s why Dwarves Discord is operated as a 50% company, 50% community. Discord is where we:

- Share our software know-how through seminars, discussion channels & tech talks
- Connect with our friends, alumni, and like-minded people
- Build an open software network that people love to be a part of.

In this update, we're thrilled to announce a new Discord System that can make it easier to connect with fellow community members.

## Welcome to our server

### Discord Roles
We’ve reorganized the discord roles system, these roles hold significant value as we're growing into an open community. They are ladder-based and function-based roles.

Along with these roles come additional activities and benefits, especially once NFT and $icy staking are introduced.

#### MMA-based new roles system
- @labs (Mastery): your expertise is admired
- @sers (Meaning): your contributions are recognized, both at work and outside.
- @chad (Autonomy): your effectiveness in terms of quality, quantity, communication, cooperation, and reliability has been noticed ~ high performer

#### Moderating
- supporter: help with day-to-day activity, welcome new folks.
- moderator: organize events, tech talks,...
- smod: run community & company-wide operational works.

#### Community members
- guest: default role upon joining
- newbie: granted after introduction, verify, get role
- frens: folks who actively discuss in our public channel

#### Consulting staffs
- apprentice: newcomers, qualified to work with us.
- baby dwarf: purpose seeking
- dwarf: joined our r&d, learning activities.
- specialist: mastery in one specific vertical

### Discord Bots
We've built some self-built bots to manage tasks and make your experience on the server more enjoyable. Here's a quick rundown:

**Mochi:** tip bot. Mochi helps you send someone a virtual pat on the back, a kudo, to show your appreciation for others.

**Tono:** the server manager. Tono is the most powerful in-house bot and keeps the Discord server running smoothly.

**Fortress:** helps us track things internally like performance tracking and issue reporting. It keeps everything running smoothly behind the scenes.

That’s all for now. You can visit Dwarves and have a good time, we look forward to seeing you [on the server.](http://discord.gg/dwarvesv)
