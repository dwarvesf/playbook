# Handover

This is the checklist for our handover process. When a new person joins a project, project members are changed, or project is moved to another team, a
handover should be thoroughly planned and executed.

## Why?

* Reduce handover time.
* Make clear for everyone how handover will affect schedules/communication/budget.
* Reduce risks of post-handover work.
* Ensure good confidence for new members.

Handover is not a task, and it is not instant. Handover is always a project. Therefore it should be planned and executed like a project. **Depend on the stage of project, the dedicated team should pick approriate checklists.**

- Handover process should only take **maximum 2 weeks**.
- Diagrams should be made using draw.io or gliffy.
- Documents should be written in markdown (.md) format and posted directly to source repo.

#### Handover completeness

Used to verify if handover was successful. Go through this list after one week of finished handover to check if it was successful. If some points can't be
marked, it means that handover is still in progress. Go through it once again after one more week. Always start
with all boxes unchecked.

- [ ] All new members have had clear tasks for past week.
- [ ] No question asked during last week about people/contacts/roles.
- [ ] No past tools were introduced (tools that were used in past, but not mentioned during handover).
- [ ] No old change request appear (that was agreed before handover and never mentioned during).
- [ ] No past communication channels were introduced (channels that were used in past, but not mentioned during handover).
- [ ] All things that were not clear (mentioned earlier) were resolved.
- [ ] All handover time is recorded.
- [ ] Every new member is confident with the project. No? Ask Why.
