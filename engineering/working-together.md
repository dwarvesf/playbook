# Pair Programming

We encourage pair programming between all levels of experience at kohactive. Nobody is required to pair program for a certain amount of time, but it is a great tool to help solve complex problems quickly and more efficiently with an extra set of eyes. 

Code that is written by two people who sit next to each other at the same computer is [pair-programmed](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html) code. That code is considered high quality and should result in cost savings due to less maintenance.

In the long run, this style of development saves money because fewer bugs are written and therefore do not need to be fixed later.

The best way to pair program is to just sit side by side in front of the monitor. Slide the key board and mouse back and forth. Both programmers concentrate on the code being written.

## How?

When pair programming, one person should “drive” while the other “navigates.” The navigator will assist the driver with the code they should write and explain the reasoning behind any code that they might dictate

The driver should be implementing the code that the navigator recommends, while frequently pausing to ask questions about the code. When the pair programming session is over, both parties should have a deep understanding of the code that they have committed

**Before:**

- Agree Scope (Pairing for two hours? Until the ticket is complete? Just get past the bug?)
- Agree Physical/Virtual Location ("Will we both be comfortable here?")
- Agree Working Environment (Two keyboards? Text editor and other tools)
- Agree Pairing Style (Time-based? Ping pong?)

**During:**

- Keep the chat going (Think aloud. Encourage/support)
- Keep switching (Follow the pairing style)
- Keep both involved ("Could we do this another way?")
- Keep breaking
- Keep checking in ("Could we search for a guide separately?")

**After:**

- Ask for Feedback (What did we do well? What could we have done better? It’ll feel weird, do it anyway)
