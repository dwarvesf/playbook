# Defect Report template

### Summary

A summary of the bug should be no more than 60 words. A good summary should be able to answer the three following questions:

- **What?** – What has happened with the application?
- **How?** – What did we click/do to produce the bug?
- **Where?** – Where exactly in the app did we find the bug? What is the webpage and/or server (environment)?

### Description

A clear and concise description should contain following sections:

#### Reproduction steps

Clearly mention the steps to reproduce the bug. For example:

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. Observed result.

#### Expected result

How the application should behave during the above steps.

#### Actual result

What is the actual result when running the above steps (the bug behavior).

#### Screenshots/Video

If applicable, add screenshots/video to help explain your problem. Remember to mark the area in the application thats impacted.

### Platform/Environment

You may need to write specifications such as the version of the project, the operating system, or the hardware if applicable.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**

- OS: [e.g. iOS]
- Browser [e.g. chrome, safari, firefox, edge]
- Resolution [e.g. 2560 X 1289]
- Version [e.g. 22]

**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**

- Device: [e.g. iPhone6]
- OS: [e.g. iOS8.1]
- Screen size: [e.g. 4.75, 5.5]
- Mobile Browser [e.g. stock browser, safari]
- Version [e.g. 22]

### Priority

The order in which a defect should be fixed. Higher the priority the sooner the defect should be resolved.

- Low: The Defect is an irritant but repair can be done once the more serious Defect has been fixed
- Medium: During the normal course of the development activities defect should be resolved. It can wait until a new version is created
- High: The defect must be resolved as soon as possible as it affects the system severely and cannot be used until it is fixed

### Severity

The measure of impact a defect (or bug) can have on the development or functioning of an application feature when it is being used. There are four types of severity:

- Critical: This defect indicates complete shut-down of the process, nothing can proceed further
- Major: It is a highly severe defect and collapses the system. However, certain parts of the system remain functional
- Medium: It causes some undesirable behavior, but the system is still functional
- Low: It won’t cause any major break-down of the system

### Some bonus tips to write a good bug report

**Report the problem immediately**

If you find any bugs while testing, then you do not need to wait to write a detailed bug report later.

**Reproduce the bug three times before writing a Bug report detail**

Your bug should be reproducible. Make sure that your steps are robust enough to reproduce the bug without any ambiguity. If your bug is not reproducible every time, then you can still file a bug mentioning the periodic nature of the bug.

**Test the same bug occurrence on other similar modules**

Sometimes the developer uses the same code for different similar modules. So there is a higher chance for the bug in one module to occur in other similar modules as well. You can even try to find the more severe version of the bug you found.

**Write a good bug summary**

Bug summary will help the developers to quickly analyze the bug’s nature. A poor quality report will unnecessarily increase development and testing time. Communicate well with your bug report summary. Keep in mind that the bug summary can be used as a reference to search for the bug in the bug inventory.

**Read the Bug report before hitting the Submit button**

Read all the sentences, wordings and steps that are used in the bug report. See if any sentence is creating ambiguity that can lead to misinterpretation. Misleading words or sentences should be avoided in order to have a clear bug report.

**Do not use abusive language**

It’s nice that you did a good work and found a bug but do not use this credit for criticizing the developer or to attack any individual.
