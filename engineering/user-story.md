# Agile requirement - User Story

## What is User Story?

In the traditional software development method, requirements are noted as a handful of documentations, specifications...

In Agile, they are User Story is requirement. User Story is:

- A convenient format for expressing the desired business value
- Crafted in a way that makes them understandable to both business people and technical people
- Used to provide a great placeholder for a conversation
- Written at various levels of granularity and are easy to refine
- Often used with the template: 
`As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>`

Example: 

- As a **User**, I want to **login into the system** so that **I can use other useful features**
- As an **Admin**, I want **the system to log the login information** so that **I can monitor who accesses the system**

**Epic**:  A very large user story that will not fit into a single iteration, does not pass the test for inclusion in an iteration, and will need to be subdivided to be considered.

**Theme**: A collection of features, epics, & stories that describe a broad business purpose.

Sometimes the User Story will also include the design/wireframe for the screen and other extra information and will be logged as an item in the backlog (Like Trello card, Gitlab issue,...)

## Some Myths about User Story that you should know

- User Stories are NOT a final requirement but rather a conversation starter between all roles
- User Stories do not always result in a feature that end-user could use, like [Spike User Story](https://www.leadingagile.com/2016/09/whats-a-spike-who-should-enter-it-how-to-word-it/)
- User Stories are a requirement and also Change Request - because we are living in an Agile world with rapid change, a user story is also a change request, an enhancement, a new feature... and it all should be treated the same and developers should NOT be scared of it
