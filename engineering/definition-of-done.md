Definition of done also known as **DoD** is a list of criteria which must be met before a product increment (story) is considered "done".

In software, Done means 

- [] coded to standards
- [] reviewed
- [] implemented with unit test
- [] tested with 100 percent test automation, integrated 
- [] and documented.

In a services context, Done means 

- [] every task under the User Story has been completed 
- [] and any work created is attached to the User Story
