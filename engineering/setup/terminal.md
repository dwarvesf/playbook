# Terminal

## Set up Unix like terminal

- On Linux you can use default terminal

- On MacOS we prefer (iTerm2)[https://iterm2.com/] instead of the default terminal. Alternative to iTerm2 is [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)

- Windows is kinda tricky, to have Unix like command you use have to install [WLS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). You can also use new [Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) which is more powerful easier to use

## Setup zsh and plugins

Our team prefer to use Z shell (Zsh) to execute commands, with [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) as plugins manager

Useful plugins/script you should install/enable to save your time.

- git - save your time with git aliases
- z - jump around you visited directory quickly
- dotenv - auto load your .env file
- zsh-completions
- zsh-autosuggestions
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
