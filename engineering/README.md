# The philosophy

We do Agile and we stand for the Craftsmanship in Software Development. The below philosophy help to shape up the way we think and react in our daily life. They are what we encourage to follow at Dwarves Foundation

## Agile

We build software. The way we see it is a collaboration between multiple people in the team with right skillset, sufficient knowledge on the domain and clear understanding on the project vision that they can quickly adapt to the changes in the market. We adopt the Agile philosophy at this level. 

> While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

Working software is the primary measure of progress. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

### **Individuals and team collaboration** over processes and tools

In order to get people on the same page, business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

### **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

## Craftsmanship

As aspiring Software Craftsmen, we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft.

> In pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.

- Not only working software, but also **well-crafted software**
- Not only responding to change, but also steadily **adding value**
- Not only individuals and interactions, but also a **community of professionals**
- Not only customer collaboration, but also **productive partnerships**

## Minimalism

**Make it work**. Perfect is enemy of good, first do it, then do it right, then do it better.

**Prioritize**. Minimalism isn't about not doing things but about focusing first in the important.

**Fail soon, learn fast**. Kill the baby, don't be afraid of starting all over again. Evaluate your work constantly. Don't be afraid of throwing to the rubbish a project you've working on last months.

**Fight for Pareto**'s law, look for the 20% of effort that will give you the 80% of results. Bear this in mind when planning the next scrum/delivery.

**Simplicity is complicated**. Simple is harder than complex. We have to write code for humans not machines. We want readability. Readable means Reliable. It's easier to understand. It's easier to work on. If it breaks, it's easier to fix.

**Basics, first**. Follow always a top-down thinking starting by the best-practises. Architecture design mean High Maintainability & Low Technical Debt. We want our applications to be easy to work with. We want to make future changes easy.

**Keep it plain**. Try to keep your designs with **few layers of indirection**. Abstraction is good, it allows us to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise. However, in some cases like refactoring we have to understand the big picture and it makes everything harder.

**Clean kipple and redundancy**. There's a concept named kipple that refers to all those things we keep but we never use. Minimalism is all about removing distractions so that we can focus in the important things.
