# Diagram and Project Document Structure

We have talk about [SDLC](https://dwarves.foundation/memo/software-development-life-cycle-101-yedyrmilyi) before and have learned that with a lot of constraints, the project is easy to fail. We could have plenty of reasons why a software project fails: team politics, overdue payment,... but three of them could be prevented easily with proper methodology, framework

- Unclear/misleading project requirements
- Wrongly defined tech stacks
- The wrong approach, develop practices

There is one secret sauce of a successful project: **Artifacts**. 
- Which artifacts should be produced? 
- Which tool should we use at Dwarves?
- Where should we store those diagrams?

Having the answer for those question give us the ability to solve at least three mentioned constraints. Avoid reinventing the wheel by following these practice which we apply here in Dwarves.

## **Artifacts**
- [BPMN](#bpmn) (hold)
- [Product Roadmap](#product-roadmap)
- [User Journey Mapping](#user-journey-mapping)
- [State Machine](#state-machine)
- [Usecase Diagram](#usecase-diagram)
- [Sequence Diagram](#sequence-diagram)
- [Activity Diagram](#activity-diagram)
- [Class Diagram](#class-diagram)
- [Stack Component Diagram](#stack-component-diagram)
- [ERD](#erd)
- [Data Flow](#data-flow)

## **Well-Alignment a.k.a Reusability**
- [Project Drive](#project-drive)
- [Message Board](#message-board)

### **BPMN**

### **Product Roadmap**

### **User Journey Mapping**
#### **Definition**
User journey mapping visualizes how a user interacts with a product and allows designers to see a product from a userâ€™s point of view.
Note the emotional state of users at each step of their journey.

This technique shows the current (as-is) user workflow, and reveals areas of improvement for the to-be workflow. 
#### **Tooling**
We use [Mermaid](https://mm.daf.ug/) to quickly establish this kind of diagram.

Start with `journey` and the title. Each user journey is split into sections, these describe the part of the task the user is trying to complete.
``` 
journey
    title My working day
    section Go to work
      Make tea: 5: Me
      Go upstairs: 3: Me
      Do work: 1: Me, Cat
    section Go home
      Go downstairs: 5: Me
      Sit down: 5: Me
```

Tasks syntax is 
``` 
Task name: <score>: <comma separated list of actors>
```

### **State Machine**
#### **Definition**
A state machine is any device storing the status of something at a given time. The status changes based on inputs, providing the resulting output for the implemented changes.

#### **Tooling**
We use [Mermaid](https://mm.daf.ug/) to quickly establish this kind of diagram. It's not a nice render btw.

The [syntax](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/diagrams-and-syntax-and-examples/stateDiagram.html) is quite easy to catchup.
```
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Still
    Still --> [*]

    Still --> Moving
    Moving --> Still
    Moving --> Crash
    Crash --> [*]
```

Consider using [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) if you want a neat diagram. Or just simply sketch on paper and take a picture of it.
