# UI Checklist
Frontend engineering is not just about producing high quality code but also attentive design. Whether you work on a design or transform a design to code, make sure the below checklist is done before you ship.

- Is relative spacing to UI elements as base unit of 4?
- Does your relative spacing match the relative spacing of similar UI elements?
- Does it look good on desktop, tablet, and mobile?
- Are you using existing elements / components where appropriate?
- Are you using the right colors from the design system?
- What happens to text when it gets too long? _(e.g. truncation, wrapping, etc)_
- Are all interactive states accounted for? _(e.g. default, touch, hover, disabled, etc)_
- Are empty states accounted for?
- Are error states accounted for?
- Are loading states accounted for?
- Are we using correct [writing styles](https://material.io/design/communication/writing.html#principles 'https://material.io/design/communication/writing.html#principles') to communicate?
- Are existing patterns being used for similar actions/items?\
  _(e.g. text link vs. secondary button, back arrow vs. back link, tooltip vs. exposed helper copy)_
- Does your icon choice communicate effectively?
