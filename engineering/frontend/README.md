# Dwarves Frontend Guide

This document is a guide to the principles and standards of building web applications by Dwarves's frontend team. We also believe that this consistency will allow us to work concurrently with multiple devs on the same codebase at the same time in the same way, producing code that is less prone to bugs and regressions, is easier to understand and debug, and supports re-use.

It is required reading for all devs (internal and external) working on our front-end development project.

- [Tech ecosystem](tech-ecosystem.md)
- [Coding styles](code-style.md)
- [Writing tests](writing-test.md)
- [UI checklist](ui-checklist.md)
- [Logging and monitoring](logging-monitoring.md)

## Contributing

We believe in consistency over freedom in coding standards, but you can still feel free to propose new guidelines or changes to existing ones.

### How to contribute

- If you have access to the repo, you can simply create a proposal branch with a name that reflects the addition or update.
- If not, fork the repo and then create a pull request when you're ready to share your changes with us.
