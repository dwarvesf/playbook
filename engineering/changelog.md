## Writing a project changelog

The project changelog is a weekly document that we create to help clients and our delivery team understand what notable changes have been made during the development time of a project.

## What is a good project changelog?

- Use bullet points for each information section. Information we provide should be simple and helpful
- Each bullet point should written in short sentence and avoid technical jargon so our changelog will be more user friendly and easier to understand
- For each change bullet point include a screenshot preview or a short 10 to 15 second of gif demo. A preview it's easier for users to visualize about changes
- Include all references and relevant resources: Jira ticket, PRs, docs, etc those are backlink to the details incase client or our team wanted to have more details

## What should included in a project changelog

### The header section

To give a quick overview of what's we have planed and done in the `header` section should provide - `TLDR;` which share highlight and summary of important changes - Team's objective which share our objective for the week

### The details section

In the detail section we will categories by few smaller sections:

- The `what news`: show client/user about new features, new things added to our projects
- The `bug fixes`: include any bug fixes and improvements
- The `work in process`: to provide client/team information about pending/opening works and things blocking our team from moving forward so team or client

**Please note:**

- Try to include not provide too many small information. Summary, rephrase combine changes if possible we don't want our change log detail too long which client might not want to read
- Gif and screenshot file should in reasonable size and quality we don't want make user have to wait for loading the previews. Say for example, a gif should last about 10 to 15 seconds and size under 12MB only beyond than that you should record again or try to reduce file size.
- Avoid using video or reference the video link because video file is not supported by email clients and people are lazy try to keep they in single page only
- Always provide backlink for PRs, Jira ticket for open/pending PRs

### The footer section

This section is optional section, includes extra information like:

- `Plan for next week` which summary what to expect for next week/sprint, since plan might change so this is optional should include in the change log of last sprint which we might already planed for next sprint

- `Resource overview` this is nice to have information, we share team's member take off plan to heads up to client and delivery team
