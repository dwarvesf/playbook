# Application and Patch Management

Effective handling of software and prompt updating are key to guarding against security weaknesses and cyber threats. Both applications and operating systems can have vulnerabilities that, if overlooked, may allow cybercriminals to breach and jeopardize our network and data.

| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Implement Application Whitelisting                   | Access Control                  | Essential | Restrict your systems to run only authorized software, effectively blocking the execution of unauthorized or malicious applications. This proactive approach ensures that only software that has been vetted and deemed necessary for business operations is allowed to run, significantly reducing the risk of malware infections. |
| Regularly Update Software                            | System Security                 | Essential | Consistently apply the latest security patches and updates to all software applications. This practice addresses vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, maintaining the integrity and security of your systems. Automate this process where possible to ensure updates are applied as soon as they are available.    |
| Use Trusted Sources for Software Downloads           | System Security                 | Essential | Always download software from official vendor sites or reputable sources. This minimizes the risk of installing malicious software disguised as legitimate applications. Avoid third-party sites where the authenticity and integrity of software cannot be guaranteed.                                                             |
| Monitor for End-of-Life Software                     | Monitoring and Alert            | Essential | Regularly review and update or replace software that has reached its end-of-life and is no longer supported by security updates from the developer. Using unsupported software increases the risk of unpatched vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.                                                                  |
| Audit Software and Application Permissions           | Access Control                  | Essential | Review and limit the permissions assigned to each application to the minimum necessary for its operation. Overly permissive applications can pose significant security risks if exploited by malicious software or actors.                                                                                                          |
| Use Software Vulnerability Scanners                  | Monitoring and Alert            | Optional  | Employ vulnerability scanning tools to identify and remediate vulnerabilities within your software portfolio. These tools can provide insights into exposed risks and recommended actions to enhance security.                                                                                                                      |
| Educate Users on Safe Application Practices          | Security Awareness and Training | Optional  | Conduct training sessions to raise awareness among users about the dangers of installing unauthorized software and the importance of adhering to organizational policies regarding software use.                                                                                                                                    |
| Backup Critical Applications and Data                | Data Security                   | Optional  | Implement a robust backup strategy for critical applications and data to facilitate quick recovery in the event of data loss, corruption, or a ransomware attack. Regular backups can minimize downtime and data breaches.                                                                                                          |
| Isolate Outdated or Vulnerable Applications          | Access Control                  | Advanced  | If certain applications cannot be updated or replaced immediately due to compatibility or operational reasons, isolate them from the network or apply additional security controls to mitigate potential risks until a solution is implemented.                                                                                     |
| Enforce Mobile Application Management (MAM) Policies | Access Control                  | Advanced  | Apply mobile application management policies to oversee and control the installation, update, and removal of apps on mobile devices. This includes enforcing security policies, managing app permissions, and ensuring that only approved apps are used on company devices.                                                         |
