# External Devices

External devices, including USB drives, external hard drives, smartphones, and tablets, provide great flexibility, making it easy to move data and connect to systems. But, this ease of use also brings risks. These devices could accidentally become channels for malware, data breaches, and unauthorized access to confidential information. Their security is often underestimated, turning them into attractive targets for cybercriminals aiming to exploit weaknesses for harmful activities.

| Recommendation                                 | Category               | Priority  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Use Encrypted Storage Devices                  | Data Security          | Essential | Choose storage devices with built-in hardware encryption capabilities (e.g [AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)) to ensure that data stored on them is automatically encrypted and protected against unauthorized access. This means even if the device is lost or stolen, the data remains inaccessible without the encryption key. |
| Enable Device Lockdown Feature                 | Access Control         | Essential | Utilize operating system features that allow control over which external devices can connect to your system. This can prevent unauthorized devices from being used to introduce malware or exfiltrate data.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Keep Device Firmware Up-to-Date                | Continuous Improvement | Essential | Consistently update the firmware of external storage devices to address known vulnerabilities and enhance their security features. Manufacturers often release firmware updates that fix security issues or provide new functionality to improve device security.                                                                                                     |
| Use Antivirus and Anti-Malware Solutions       | System Security        | Essential | Before accessing any content from external devices, scan them with reliable antivirus and anti-malware software to detect and remove potential threats. This helps prevent the spread of malware that could compromise your system’s security.                                                                                                                        |
| Disable Autorun/AutoPlay                       | System Security        | Essential | Disabling Autorun/AutoPlay features on your computer prevents the automatic execution of executable files on external devices, reducing the risk of auto-executing malware. This setting can usually be configured within the operating system’s control panel.                                                                                                       |
| Regularly Backup and Wipe Unused Devices       | Data Security          | Essential | Ensure important data on external devices is backed up regularly to a secure location. Devices no longer in use should be securely wiped using appropriate software tools to prevent data recovery and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.                                                                                                        |
| Audit and Log Device Connections               | Monitoring             | Essential | Keep a log of when and which external devices are connected to your system. Regular audits can help detect unauthorized access or anomalous activity, providing insights into potential security breaches or misuse of external devices.                                                                                                                              |
| Implement Physical Access Controls             | Physical Security      | Optional  | Enhance the security of external devices by implementing physical access controls. This can include using locks for device storage, secure enclosures, or keeping them in restricted areas accessible only to authorized personnel, thereby reducing the risk of theft or unauthorized access.                                                                        |
| Use Strong Authentication for External Devices | Access Control         | Optional  | For devices containing sensitive information, implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as biometric verification or hardware tokens, to access the device. This adds an additional layer of security, ensuring only authorized users can access the device's contents.                                                                                        |
| Restrict External Device Access                | Access Control         | Advanced  | On systems that handle sensitive data, restrict or entirely prohibit the connection of external devices. This minimizes the risk of data exfiltration and malware introduction, safeguarding critical information.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Enable Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Tools        | Data Security          | Advanced  | Deploy DLP solutions to monitor and control data being transferred to and from external devices. These tools can help prevent unauthorized transfer or copying of sensitive information, ensuring data remains secure.                                                                                                                                                |
| Physically Disable Unused Ports                | Physical Security      | Advanced  | To further enhance security, physically disable ports that are not in use, such as USB ports on public or sensitive computers. This can be done through BIOS settings or physically, to prevent unauthorized device connections.                                                                                                                                      |
