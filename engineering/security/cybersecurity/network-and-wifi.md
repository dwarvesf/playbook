# Network and WiFi

With the widespread use of the internet, the threats from unsecured connections and networks have significantly increased. Cybercriminals take advantage of these vulnerabilities to conduct attacks, which can range from eavesdropping on unencrypted networks to executing sophisticated ransomware and phishing breaches. Therefore, securing your network and WiFi connections is essential, not merely a recommendation.

There are two main vectors of vulnerability in network security: unsecured networks and compromised equipment. Unsecured WiFi networks, often found in public spaces, provide an easy access point for malicious actors to intercept data. On the other hand, compromised routers and networking equipment can become gateways for cyberattacks, allowing intruders to infiltrate private networks and access sensitive information.

| Recommendation                         | Category               | Priority  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable WPA3 Encryption                 | Data Security          | Essential | Upgrade your router to support [WPA3](https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/security), the latest security protocol for Wi-Fi networks. WPA3 provides stronger encryption and better protection against brute-force attacks compared to its predecessors. If your router supports WPA3, enable it to enhance the security of your Wi-Fi network. |
| Set a Strong WiFi Password             | Access Control         | Essential | Create a robust and unique password for your Wi-Fi network using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The password should be at least 16 characters long to make it difficult for attackers to guess or crack. Avoid using personal information or common words.                                                     |
| Regularly Update Router Firmware       | Continuous Improvement | Essential | Keep your router's firmware up-to-date to address security vulnerabilities, bugs, and enhance the device's overall performance. Manufacturers often release firmware updates that patch security flaws, thus protecting your network from potential exploits.                                                                                   |
| Disable WPS                            | System Security        | Essential | WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) offers a convenient way to connect devices to your Wi-Fi network but also poses a security risk as it can be exploited to gain unauthorized access. Disable WPS in your router's settings to eliminate this vulnerability.                                                                                           |
| Separate Guest Network                 | Network Segmentation   | Essential | Set up a separate Wi-Fi network for guests to ensure they can access the internet without compromising the security of your primary network and connected devices. This isolates guest traffic from your main network, protecting sensitive data.                                                                                               |
| Disable Remote Management              | System Security        | Essential | Turn off any features that allow your router to be managed from an external network. Remote management can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized control of your router. Limiting router management to the local network increases security.                                                                                           |
| Use a Firewall                         | Security               | Essential | Enable the built-in firewall on your router to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic and block potential threats. For enhanced protection, consider installing additional firewall software on your devices to detect and prevent unauthorized access.                                                                                          |
| Implement MAC Address Filtering        | Access Control         | Optional  | Use MAC address filtering to allow only specific devices to connect to your network. This adds an extra layer of security by ensuring only pre-approved devices can access the network, although it requires regular management to update allowed devices.                                                                                      |
| Turn Off SSID Broadcasting             | Access Control         | Optional  | Disable SSID broadcasting to make your Wi-Fi network less visible to nearby devices. This can reduce the likelihood of unauthorized attempts to connect to your network, although it requires manually entering the network name to connect.                                                                                                    |
| Limit DHCP Leases                      | Access Control         | Optional  | Restrict the number of devices that can connect to your network by limiting the DHCP server's IP address pool. This helps manage the number of devices on your network and can limit unauthorized access.                                                                                                                                       |
| Use Static IP Addresses for Devices    | Access Control         | Optional  | Assign static IP addresses to important devices within your network. This aids in network management, security monitoring, and ensures consistent network communication for critical devices.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Network Monitoring Tools               | Monitoring             | Optional  | Employ network monitoring tools to keep an eye on connected devices and network traffic. This can help in the early detection of unauthorized access, suspicious activities, and potential security breaches.                                                                                                                                   |
| Encrypt DNS Traffic                    | Data Security          | Optional  | Enable DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) on your network to encrypt DNS queries. This prevents third parties from intercepting and manipulating your DNS traffic, enhancing your privacy and security online.                                                                                                                          |
| Use VPN                                | Data Security          | Advanced  | Encourage the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for conducting sensitive transactions or accessing important resources, especially when using public or untrusted Wi-Fi networks. VPNs encrypt data in transit, providing an additional layer of security.                                                                                 |
| Implement Network Access Control (NAC) | Access Control         | Advanced  | Deploy Network Access Control (NAC) systems to enforce security policies across your network. NAC systems can grant or block access to the network based on the compliance of connected devices with your organization's security policies.                                                                                                     |
