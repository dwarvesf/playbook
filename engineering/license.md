# Licensing

## Why license?
By definition, license is a permit from an authority to own or use something. In software development, the term expanded to the permission to use the software as well as the source code itself.

Understanding licenses will help you to prevent a lot of painful situation in the future, including lawsuit involvement.

## Copyright and Copyleft
*In general, copyright law is used by an author to prohibit recipients from reproducing, adapting, or distributing copies of their work.*

When you make a creative work (such as writing, graphics, or **code**), that work is under exclusive copyright by default. That is, the law assumes that as the author of your work, you have a say in what others can do with it.

*Copyleft, distinguished from copyright, is the practice of offering people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of a work **with the stipulation that the same rights be preserved in derivative works created later**.*

Copyleft software licenses are considered protective or reciprocal, as contrasted with permissive free-software licenses.

## Complicated, but just a few things to remember
### Your work:
- If you do not include any [Opensource license](https://opensource.org/licenses) in your source code, that mean that no one have the rights to use it.

- If you want your code to be freely used, modified, distributed, simply include the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) in it.

- If you want anyone that uses your code have to public theirs as well, put [GNU General Public License](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) in your license file.

### Using other's work:
- **NEVER, EVER** use anyone code/product without the proper license (Cracked software, Unauthorize licenses...).

- If you use an opensource that is under any copyleft license (Example: GNU General Public License), you should understand that your code must be under the same license, meaning, it must be public.
- **Don't use any code that under copyleft license OR does not have any license associated (copyrighted) in client project.**
- Do include the approriate license.md in your source code
- Inform clients about all of the opensource that you are about to use in your code and in an official document 
- **If you are not sure about licensing, contact your supervisor or lawyer for their opinion**
