# Technology Stack

### Our perspective on Technology

#### New technology needs to provide actual value over existing solutions

Software is changing the world every day. Software moves fast. The technology you used yesterday may be deprecated today. New technology has enabled us to create new things.

The world is running by the goodwill of people who try to make it a better place. With the existing set of problems, new solutions will come out along with new technologies. When we look at new tech, we think about the movement of the market & society on which the new tech could fit in. The main idea is to see if the new tech could help to make anything better than before in the long run and also serve our development direction.

#### Make sure you understand both the old technology and the new one before buying into the next new thing

We continuously evaluate new technologies using our tech radar. They are classified into topics: Techniques, Tools, Platforms, Languages & Frameworks with category:

- Adopt: We feel strongly that the industry could be adopting these items. We use them approriate on our projects.
- Trial: Worth pursuing. It is important to understand how to build up this capability. We could try those technologies on a project that can handle the risk.
- Assess: Worth exploring with the goal of understanding how it will affect the company.
- Hold: The items that need to proceed with caution.

### Technology Index

#### Tools

- Basecamp: Project management and team communication software by 37signals.
- Gitlab: Git is like a time machine. We have our self-host source version control.
- VSCode & Vim: Our popular editor of choice to be productive. There are a few members who prefer to use emacs, but our point is always the right tool for the right job.
- Sketch & Figma: A primary design tool for UI Design and collaboration between the development team.

#### Techniques

- Scrum: an agile framework for team collaboration
- Docker-centered: our workflow that uses Docker container in every phase of the development lifecycle. It ensures the runtime isolation and eases the development/deployment process.
- CI/CD: a practice to integrate, build, and deploy source code efficiently.
- Gitflow: a branching model for git which helps save time and organize development team activity on the codebase.
- Code Review: a part of our software QA activity that helps identify bugs and defects before the testing phase.

#### Platforms

- Docker: the engine enables containerized applications to run anywhere consistently on any infrastructure.
- AWS: Cloud computing services by Amazon
- GCP: Cloud computing services by Google
- Istio: An open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices by Google
- Netlify: All-in-one platform for modern web development

#### Languages

- Golang
- Elixir
- Rust
- React.js
- Vue.js
- Kotlin
