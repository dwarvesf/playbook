# Scrum at Dwarves Foundation

Agile, Scrum, XP... These are the trendy keywords that always on the top of the results for software development methodology

- Everyone knows about Scrum
- A lot of people wants to apply Scrum
- But only a few people really use Scrum

SO what is ***Scrum*** exactly?

## Sprint

**Timebox:** 1 month or less (Preferable: 2 weeks)
<br>**Roles:** Whole teams
<br>**Remarks:**
- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
- Quality goals do not decrease
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

During the Sprint, there are four Sprint Events that will happen.

## Sprint Events
### **Daily Scrum**
***When:*** Daily, *stand up* in the office OR Slack 
<br> ***Timebox:*** Maximum 15 minutes
<br>***Who:*** Scrum Team
<br>***To do what:***
- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Any blockages?    

***Remarks:***
- No chit chat
- Be on time
- No solution discussion, take it offline or set up another meeting if needed

### **Sprint Planning**
**When:** Start of every Sprint
<br>**Timebox:** Maximum time = Number of week * 2 (hrs)
<br>**Who:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Scrum Team
<br>**To do what:**
- What can be done this Sprint?
- Define Sprint Goal
- How will the chosen work get done?

**Remarks:**
- The goal is solid, but solution could be changed
- If there is any solution changes or unexpected events occurred, discuss with PO to re arrange the work

### **Sprint Review**
**When:** Start of every Sprint
<br>**Timebox:** Maximum time = Number of week * 2 (hrs)
<br>**Who:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Scrum Team
<br>**To do what:**
- Demo of what have been done
- Product Owner explains what have been “Done”, what has not been “Done”
- Backlog refinement if needed

**Remarks:**
- If there is anything that the Scrum Team think that it will make the product better, Sprint Review is the time to advise the stackholders
- Demo could be useful for Dev to show off their work as well as presenting skills
- Understading how customer would use it will help the Scrum Team in future development
### **Sprint Retrospective**
<br>**When:** Start of every Sprint
<br>**Timebox:** Maximum time = Number of week * 2 (hrs)
<br>**Who:** Scrum Team
**To do what:**
- What when well last Sprint?
- What could be improved?
- How could we improved?

**Remarks:**
- It’s a ghost buster event, not shaming event
- Improve one thing at a time, focus on things that are *small* but **most painful**


## Scratching the itches
### ***I changed my mind, again!!!***
>It’s Agile, we can change anything at anytime!

Sounds familiar?

For the teams that have a Scrum Master, it’s his/her responsibility to protect the team from those changes during the Sprint, but for the smaller teams that work directly with clients they usually being distracted by those changes all the time.

Changes are inevitable, but everyone needs to remember that changes take *Time*, *Effort* and therefore **Money**

Remember:

    No problem, just stick it into the backlog

Then we can discuss it in the Sprint Planning

### ***Ain’t nobody got time for that***

“Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.” — *Scrum Guide*
