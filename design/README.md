# Dwarves Design Playbook

Dwarves Design is a young and small design studio, founded in 2018. 

We provide design service which helps young entrepreneurs to visualize their innovative ideas. By applying Design Thinking, we focus on research, define problems, design and test products, which help to reduce cost and time.

I’m often asked ‘How do I get everyone bought into doing (design thinking, Lean Startup, customer discovery, etc.)?’. We need a design process to make sure our team will be able to deliver the results and improve the performance of our client’s product sprint-by-sprint.
The process defines how you start designing a new feature with sketching and prototyping, how you iterate and how you deliver the pixel-perfect result. 

We will walk you through the process we choose, how we deal with problems day-by-day and sprint-by-sprint. We already have courses during the working days to make sure everyone is on the same page.

Have fun and work smart.
