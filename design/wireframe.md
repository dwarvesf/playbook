## Wireframe: Workflow Design

Created on scraps of paper, a whiteboard, or in a software program, serve to establish relationships between elements in a project such as navigation, imagery, and calls to action.
Often, a wireframe has 3 core goals:
* To show the content and functionality of the pages before any further designs.
* To help designers communicate with clients about the design concept.
* To establish the information hierarchy of the site.
