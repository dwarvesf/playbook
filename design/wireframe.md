## Wireframe: Workflow Design

Created on scraps of paper, a whiteboard, or in a software program, serve to establish relationships between elements in a project such as navigation, imagery, and calls to action.
Often, a wireframe has 3 core goals:
* To show the content and functionality of the pages before any further designs.
* To help designers communicate with clients about the design concept.
* To establish the information hierarchy of the site.

## Information Architecture

Information architecture (IA) is, like a blueprint, a visual representation of the product’s infrastructure, features, and hierarchy. IA provides designers (as well as product development and engineering teams) a bird’s-eye view of the entire product.
