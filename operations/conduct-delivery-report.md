Our goal is to allocate resources efficiently, assign the right staff to the right tasks, and address issues appropriately. At a high level, our delivery report will answer three key questions:

1. **Did we help the client achieve their targets?**
2. How did the team perform?
3. Are there any problems that need to be resolved?

Below is the process that our delivery team follows to answer these questions effectively:

### Data Gathering

#### Artifact Collection

Collect the proof of work each project team delivered during the month. This includes:

- Demo materials (videos, screenshots)
- Updated project charters, documents, diagrams, and source code
- Logs of roadblocks, issues, and technical debts

From this process, we also observe and gather potential problems, both technical and managerial.

#### Team Performance

Evaluate the team's performance based on the following criteria:

- Do account managers advocate for and ensure the interests of the client?
- Do tech leads/project managers consult with the client on development matters?
- Do tech leads/project managers ensure delivery quality and effective team management?
- Assess each team member's performance and workload (to be discussed with team leads).

#### Project Priority

Assess the importance of each project based on factors such as:

- Deal size
- Potential to open new opportunities
- Strategic partnerships

### Conducting the Report

Once all data is collected, we compile it into a report with highlights for the following items:

- **Project Sorting by Importance:** Rank projects based on their priority and significance to our overall goals.
- **Client Happiness and Performance Ratings:** Rate client satisfaction, lead performance, and account performance on a scale of 1 to 5.
- **Issues and Resolutions Logs:** Document any issues encountered and the resolutions implemented.
