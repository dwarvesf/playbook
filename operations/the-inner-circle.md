The concept of an "inner circle" within a company is not a new one, and at Dwarves, a software company founded by a group of engineers, this idea holds a significant value. Starting from scratch, the company has always placed emphasis on being surrounded by individuals who can efficiently ship software and don't waste time on unimportant tasks. These individuals are highly respected and valued within the company, as they play a crucial role in the development and success of projects.

It's not difficult to differentiate between those who can effectively contribute to the shipping process and those who cannot. Those who lack the ability to ship software efficiently are often viewed as a hindrance to the team and are not given the same level of respect and attention. This concept of valuing those who can effectively contribute to the development and shipping process is not exclusive to Dwarves, but is a structure found in many groups and organizations.

At Dwarves, there is also an inner circle of individuals who run the company and play a pivotal role during times of crisis. This inner circle is not formed through official invitations or set criteria, but rather through earning the respect and recognition of the group. Those who consistently demonstrate their value and ability to contribute to the development and success of the company are the ones who are recognized and included in this inner circle.

It is not about who one knows or what they have done in the past, but rather, it's about consistently showing that they matter and can make a significant impact on the company's success. This is the key to being a part of the inner circle at Dwarves.
