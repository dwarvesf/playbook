## 1Password storage
Link to company 1Password: [https://dwarvesv.1password.com](https://dwarvesv.1password.com/). We have 2 accounts for 1Password usage:

- **Team account**: This should stores all of company's account and will be shared with the correspondent team members. To get access to this information, please contact your line manager OR Operation team. *This account should NOT be shared with people outside of D.F*
- **Operation account**: This account stores the confidential credentials that related to Operation team and should only shared to people within the Ops Team.

## Updating secret key
In order to keep the confidential information from leaking out, Operation team will continuously update the account's secret key overtime.

The latest key will be stored here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x2JzetR_8CkQcoHFo4J1U99zLynPZYmz
