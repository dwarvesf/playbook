In today's competitive business environment, it is crucial for organizations to have a clear understanding of the value and performance of their employees. In a recent post I wrote, titled "[Inner Circle](/db6561d944f4443789dfef3f12a87496)", I expounded on the importance of contribution and value in relation to a person's work or performance. However, there is another key aspect to this topic that must be taken into consideration. One of the most effective ways to determine how well a person is performing is by asking the question, "**Are you helping?**" Through evaluating the output of an individual's work, we can gain a clear understanding of how much value they are providing and how well they are performing.

It is essential to recognize that salary and job title are not the only indicators of an employee's value. Salary is merely a social contract that pre-agrees on how much a person will be paid based on the value they produce. A job title, on the other hand, defines the scope of a person's work. When an individual is not producing the agreed upon value, they may be viewed negatively and conflicts may arise in the workplace. In such cases, it is vital to remember that the true measure of a person's worth is their ability to help and contribute to the success of the organization or team.

Another significant aspect to consider is that when an individual is not performing up to expectations, they may be deemed **overpaid**. This can lead to increased expectations from colleagues and managers, as well as negative evaluations during performance reviews. Therefore, it is vital to understand that producing value is the key to success in any organization and that salary and job title should not be the only factors considered when evaluating an employee's worth and performance.

In conclusion, organizations must recognize that the value and performance of employees is crucial for their success. Asking the question "**Are you helping?**" can provide valuable insight into the worth and performance of employees. Additionally, it is essential for organizations to understand that salary and job title should not be the only factors considered when evaluating an employee's value. The ability to help and contribute to the success of the organization is the true measure of an employee's worth.
