Hey there!

You’re receiving this because you’ve interacted with Dwarves Team through our [website](https://dwarves.foundation/), our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dwarvesf) posts, or the active [Discord Network](https://discord.gg/dwarvesv?fbclid=IwAR0qISIXoxthRyof3yka_P12oWH6ixd5RVwCXBWna5NYJpgqho0M0zRIN8M).

No matter which platform you’ve stopped by, we thank you for doing that! Welcome to **Dwarves Updates**.

**Dwarves Updates** is where we share our lesson learned, where we head to and what we stay proud of - as a team. Short enough for your morning coffee, and get delivered once every month.

Dwarves Foundation is an innovative tech firm. We help business resolve their problem using tech solutions, offshore development and technical consultancy.

We simply want everyone who visits Dwarves Team can somehow be a part of our journey. It’s the companion that makes the road enjoyable.
