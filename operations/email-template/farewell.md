**Title**: Dwarves Foundation - Farewell Letter

**Body**

Hi [**name**],

On behalf of DF, we would like to express our gratitude for contribution in the last three months.

However, we are regret to inform that your probationary period at DF will be concluded since your performance cannot meet our expectation. Still, we want to thank you for spending your time and effort being a part of the team.

We encourage you to re-apply for any of our next vacant positions in your expertise area. In the mean time, may all the good luck will come to you in your next endeavor.

Thank you,
Dwarves Foundation
