Finding solitude in information overwhelming world

Nowadays, we are connected 247, every minute passes by there are new things happens, new notifications, endless distractions. Sometimes, it is too hard to focus and it affect our life quality a lot.

So there are couple things that we can do to avoid this problem.

### Spend time to be alone everyday
It can be 1–2 hours and you can truly focus on what ready matter. I spend a lot of time alone, maybe a long walk, maybe reading time, maybe exercising time, but those times bring a lot of new & better ideas to solve other problems

### Remove background noise
For not urgent things, I always want to **use asynchronous communications, like text or email**, because interruption wastes us a lot of time. I always prefer scheduled meeting time than just random chat. I block facebook and most noise sites on my phones. Most of the things are just noise, focus on what matters actually make a huge difference in results, information is no exception

### Have time just doing nothing
Doing nothing means actually doing nothing, watching a movie is not doing nothing. It’s easy to be trapped in to the busy world, for me, unproductive busy is worse than doing nothing. Sometimes, doing nothing is the best thing you can do.

### Have very fresh & slow mornings
We should not rush through the morning because that’s the most productive & creative time. Morning is the time to complete that hardest tasks. It can make or break your day, morning is the time for you to do the most meaningful work before everything else.

### Go with the [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)
You know that there are times you are really at the flow and you should repeat that by different methods. One of my favorite ways is repeating a favorite song over and over again while working something else. Time just passes by and I really deep dive into what I’m doing and get extreme productive.

In conclusion, information disorder can be an unknown unknown problem for a lot of people, it means you are not aware of about that problem, and you do not know that you have that problem. Until you realize it, you will know you have been wasting a lot of time looking at Facebook every day.
