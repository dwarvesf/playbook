### What is OKR
OKR (**O**bject and **K**ey **R**esult) is a management methodology, an outcome-driven tracking framework.

**Object**: is a goal we want to achieve

**Key Results**: are a set of explaination for how will we know we are getting there. 

**For example**

In Q1/2018 DF's objective is want to build a strong backend team, so "**build a strong backend team"** is an object, to accomplish that, we will **hire 2 senior backend developers** and **organize 1 training session per week**, each of them is a key result to let us know whether we are getting to our objective or not. So our OKR in foundation level will look like this.

**BUILD A STRONG BACKEND TEAM**

- [ ] Hire 2 senior backend developer
- [ ] Organize 1 training session per week

After that, in team level, the HR team will know what they will do in the next 3 months (Hire 2 senior backend team), so it will be their objective.

**HIRE 2 SENIOR BACKEND DEVELOPER**

- [ ] Interview 30 candidates before 1/2
- [ ] Pick 20 of them for probations before 10/2
- [ ] Choose 2 of them before 1/3

Finally, in individual level, each staff from HR team will know their objective.

**INTERVIEW 30 CANDIDATES before 1/2**

- [ ] Post a job in ITViec before 10/1
- [ ] Go to 10 meet-up events to connect with potential candidates

### Keys to OKR
* **Set quarterly and annually**
* **Measurable**

It is one of the most important thing in OKR, every key result of an object must be measurable because it is the only thing will let us know whether we a getting close to our objective or we just playing around

> *It's not a key result unless it has a number - Marissa Mayer ( CEO of yahoo )*

So we will say "i will launch this project in **August**" instead of say "i will launch this project **as soon as i can**"

* **Set as personal and team level**
Like an example above, we set a ORK for both personal and team level as a top-down approach, but in every company individual is a must for development . As a CEO or board member of the company, they should collect their staff ORKs and build a foundation level OKR base on their staff's (bottom-up).

* **Share**
The entire company have a access to everyone ORK including team ORK, so everyone will know that they are working for the same goals and what everyone is working on

* **Graded**
You will give a point in the scale from 0 to 1, the point will show the percentage of a given Key results. Let's say "Hire 2 senior backend developer" but we only hired 1, so we will point this Key result **0.5 point.** The objective point is an average of Key results.
 
The ideal point is 0.6 - 0.7 point . You may ask why it's not 0.9 or 1, well if it seems easy either your objectives are not ambitious enough or you did it wrong

* **Maximum 5 objective per quarter and 4 key results for each of them**

### Why is it better than normal KPI indicators?
* **OKRs Increase Clarity**

The main goal of OKRs is to connect company, team and personal objectives to measurable results, making people move together in right direction.

> *First, and most importantly, the company must have conviction around goal setting. This commitment needs to come from all levels: the CEO, the senior leadership team, and every team member within the company. That’s the best way to ensure success. - John Doerr*

* **OKRs Increase Focus**

We'd only focus on the right result leads to our objectives, keep track of the progress and know that we are moving in the right direction

* **OKRs Increase Collaboration**

We’d simply get in touch with the people you’d need to work with on these projects and find a common ground with them so that the work ended up on each person’s OKR list.

### How to apply OKR to team Foundation
**The process**

1. **Brainstorm session:** before the beginning of quarter, we will think the Quarter objectives
1. **Company-wide communicate**: let everyone know what the objectives for the next quarter
1. **Draft personal okr**

**Use OKR with Hygger Board**

* We use Sprint type board for each quarter
* Have a company OKR column, each card is a objective, use checklist as key results
* Each person will have different OKR column, each card is a objective, use checklist as key results
