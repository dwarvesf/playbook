This is the culture test for Dwarves, developed as we face the challenges of the late 2024 market. The goal is simple: to focus on what matters most, our cultural values. This test isn’t about jumping through hoops; it’s about understanding how we work, what we stand for, and how you can contribute.

It includes personal stories, practical applications, and creative problem-solving tasks. Scoring 60+ points is great, but what really matters is being honest, thoughtful, and aligned with the Dwarves Foundation spirit.

**Language:** You may write in **Vietnamese** or **English.**  
**Passing Score:** Achieving **60 points** is considered **qualified.**
