I would like to introduce to you our new initiative called **OGIF** — Oh God It's Friday. Moving forward, our Friday Showcase will have a broader range of topics to discuss and share.

Let's take a moment to reflect on our achievements from the past week, and look forward to the next with optimism and enthusiasm.

### The tradition
At Dwarves, we value work-life balance and believe that it comes after fulfilling our responsibilities. We surround ourselves with hard-working individuals and provide ample resources and opportunities for them to grow.

We understand that some may not resonate with the idea of TGIF, as it implies an escape from a job that they are not passionate about. Instead, we encourage everyone to pursue their interests and passions, and not spend their life working on something they don't enjoy. I feel sorry for you.

Our 70/50 culture is a well-adopted protocol among us. It means dedicating 70% of our time to our duties, and investing 50% in personal growth. 30% of Dwarves continue working on their side projects after fulfilling their weekly commitments, indicating their desire for growth.

Our goal is to grow and make a positive impact in society, while also making a living. We are proud of the dedication and hard work that have built Dwarves. We have shipped more than 20 software and worked with 20+ clients. Our graduates continue to outperform their peers in their future endeavors.

### New topics
We are open to discussing growth opportunities, and welcome any topic related to tech, social development, finance, and career path on Fridays. Let's take this time to ***appreciate our accomplishments*** and look forward to the future.

Not everyone may agree with our ideas, but we hope to provide a welcoming community for those who do.

TGIF sometime, OGIF all the time.

Cheers,
