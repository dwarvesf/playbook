A couple days ago, I was asked if I were ever a product person, what would I do to make the best out of it.

It took me a while. I mean, I've never walked in this shoe before. Wth is a product person? I wondered. And I started digging. Here it is, "Making sure your product/ thing shipped out flawlessly." A perfectionist mindset.

Sounds a bit crazy, yet a lil intrigued. Intrigued enough to leave me with some concepts.

## No one wants a poor product
And no one wants to work with people who keep making poor products. We, indeed, all want to use things in their best states. So why bear being someone who creates a poor one? That just doesn't make any sense.

## Exceed the Expectation
Can't stand the idea of using low standard things? Train yourself with the habit of upgrading. Every time you look back on what you've worked on, there should be something to optimize. At least that's how I feel whenever I look back on my writings. I can finish it in pride, then look at it 3 weeks later and feel like it's full of crap. Sometimes it doesn't take me up to 3 weeks. Sometimes it's tomorrow.

## Notice the little things
Little things count. They really do. Pay attention to your work, how you approach, how you solve or react to it. You eventually find it's the completion of those details that fulfills the big picture.

Polishing your work tells the most about your work ethic. Remember when they say: "How you treat yourself is how you teach people to treat you"? The same thing happens with products.

## Extra mile >< Overwork
Extra mile has nothing to do with overwork. Here's a fact. You can only go the extra mile with what you truly want. That's how you lift it to a higher level. That's how you go 'extra.' Taking pride in what you do makes it hard to fail in the long run.

After all, doing one thing ideally is way better than ten things half-ass.
