## Getting Started
This is a part from our study how to recognize people traits at the first sight. This guide is made to help HRs or Project Lead have a quick view of potential candidates and/or new teammates personality. Working with nature is more productive than working against it.

No personality type is inherently better or more desirable than another in general. This reference is applied to the tech industry only.

MBTI reveals **how we tend to interact/think.** It’s not that Thinkers don’t feel or Feelers don’t think, but only that they differ in the degree. The same for other preferences (I/E, S/N, P/J)

## The Basic
The MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) is a framework designed to identify a person's personality type, strengths, and preference. Each type have [4 preferences](/cdeaa142edca44669867f8fbb120c342) among 8 available preferences.

## Strategy for better guess
* Background check with their social media.
* Ask their colleagues/ friends that we have acquainted with.
* Avoid over-focusing on particular, e.g. The talkative doesn't mean extrovert
* If we don't know their exact type, define **"Which type are they least like?"**
* Understand the cognitive function stack to define the type's framework. 

Search "Type name + function stack", e.g. INFP function stack to get the information.

* Note: **Don’t ever tell the candidates that we care about their MBTI.** It can affect the result’s accuracy.
