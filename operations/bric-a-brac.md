- Outsource things which are super important but we are not excellent at.
- Spend time selecting a vendor and occasionally spend time reevaluating other vendors.
- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Give everyone "admin" access to as much as possible to avoid bottlenecks.
- Our problems are not unique. We will try manual processes first. When we do build something, it is usually after using other things for years.
