* **Grit**: Look for a time the candidate wanted something so badly, they were unstoppable in pursuing it. Or a time they overcame an obstacle.
* **Rigor**: Ask candidates to tell you about a time they used data to make a decision. Look for details about the complexity of the data and how the thinking happened, rather than focusing on the right answer
* **Impact**: Have your candidate tell you about a time they had a measurable (read: quantitative) impact on a job or an organization.
* **Teamwork**: Look for candidates who know their own strengths and weaknesses, and can empathize with others — the hallmark of empathy and high EQ. Ask what a candidate’s best friends would cite as their key strengths and weaknesses
* **Ownership**: To “test” for this in an interview, ask about a time they experienced an injustice, and then empathize with the unfairness. You empathize with: ‘Are you kidding? That's crazy. What a jerk.’ Owners will immediately respond with something like, ‘Yeah, but I recognized it wasn't worth my time to complain about it.' They won’t buy in and double down on venting or complaining.
* **Curiosity**: Start by asking a prospective hire the last thing they really geeked out about. It doesn’t have to be work-related—in fact, it may be better if it’s not.
* **Polish**: Polish is equal parts what candidates say and how they say it, so be sure you’re considering both. How do they conduct themselves when they interject? Do they send a thoughtful thank you note following your conversation? Do they communicate gracefully and efficiently, saying whip-smart things in the fewest words possible?
