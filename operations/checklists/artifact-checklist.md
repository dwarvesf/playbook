## Why do we need artifacts?
- Track the project’s progress against the plan, making it easier to manage and control
- Future team members can learn from past projects, understanding the decisions made, the problems faced, and how they were solved
- Smoothen the handover and onboarding process, track record, and trace back if needed.
