### Why do we need artifacts?
- Track the project’s progress against the plan, making it easier to manage and control
- Serve as a record of what was done and can be referred to in case of any disputes or misunderstandings with the client
- Future team members can learn from past projects, understanding the decisions made, the problems faced, and how they were solved
- Smoothen the handover and onboarding process
