## Invoice Process
### Person In Charge (PIC)
Person In Charge for invoice will be the person in charge of the Account, if the Account doesn't have any person in charge, other people in the Operation team will be in charge. Ideally, the second Person In Charge will be the Salesperson of the project. 

For example: Nam will be the second person in charge of the Attrace account, as she is the Salesperson of this project

### Invoice statuses
- Every month, Fortress will automatically generate the invoices based on the previous month for the projects that are opening ( At this stage the invoice will be saved as Draft )
- During the 25th - 27th of each month, PIC will need to send out the Off-days report to Special Clients and seek out for their confirmation
- PIC will need to check the invoice content (Including member time-off)
- After received feedbacks from clients and reviewed all invoice contents, PIC will send the official  invoice to client. ( Status will be changed to Sent )
- When Han receives the money transferred from client, he will change the invoice status to Paid
- If the invoice has not been paid 7 days after the send date, its status will be changed to Overdue . PIC will need to send a follow up email for the invoice
- In any case, if there are errors after the invoices have been sent to clients, we can mark the invoices as 'Error' and PIC need to send an email explains why the invoice is incorrect, and make a new invoice to resend to client
