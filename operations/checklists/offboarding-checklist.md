An off-boarding process must ensure three things
- Your employee feels good
- The departure causes minimal disruption.
- The termination process must be well-wrapped to make sure the company policy and procedures are all conformed.

## Account removal
Account removal should be applied for work channels, such as Basecamp or Jira. Otherwise, we welcome the employee to stay around in Discord and participate in community events. 

## Device collecting
Once the employee has finished his/her meeting with the Lead and finally have the offboarding date, the employee should wrap up his/her handover process and send back the work tools. 

That includes working device, subscription account, office key or parking card.
