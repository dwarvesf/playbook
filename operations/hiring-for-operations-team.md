Operations is a very sensitive area of the company, so be very picky. A great ops person can dramatically improve the way your company works and make your life a lot easier.

**Operations is operations, no matter the industry**

Operations problems are almost the same everywhere (in ultra-specialized and regulated industries we just surround ourselves with specialists and attorneys). Industry experience is helpful, but not as much as you think.

**A good operations leader will be a specialist in being the connector and arbiter between functional areas**.

*Hands-on* experience in the areas of IT, HR, accounting, recruiting, infrastructure, marketing, sales, etc. is very important. Lack of it handicaps.

**An operations leader should have no qualms about getting his/her hands dirty**

No white gloves here! But at the same time they should have very good judgment when to give someone opportunity to struggle a bit, so they learn.

**Real operations people will have backup plans for backup plans**

This is how our heads work ALL the time (at work and home). You will not find us bungee jumping or skydiving because there is only one backup in case of failure.

**Those fearing dirt and scars have no place in operations**.

Operations people should be the Secret Service of the company. Not only are we most instrumental in sustainable growth of the company, but we also take a lot of “bullets” and “cuts”. We are like an adult or a parent in the company – constantly removing impediments, cleaning up the messes, leading discipline, and taking the fall for others. If the operations team works well, everything runs smoothly and very few have full comprehension of the massive load we have on our shoulders.

**Instead of “faking it”, a good operations person will pick up the phone and ask for advice from experts**.

A large contact list of suppliers, vendors, and specialists is essential for our everyday success.

**We should be able to speak the “language” of every professional on the team.**

Earning credibility with everyone in the organization is extremely important to the success of the person in this position. It is hard! No, it is actually extremely hard. It is the hardest thing in this list and perfection here is almost impossible. Job is much easier if the board and CEO how respect due to the operations team.
