We're designers and developers. We want to design and develop software. Before we can do that, we need clients to hire us. The following section details how our sales process works and answers commonly asked questions by potential clients.

The overall process is:

- Someone contacts us.
- We have them fill out our new project form.
- We have a phone call or have them come into the office.
- Qualify/disqualify: are we a good fit for the client?
- Qualify/disqualify: is the client a good fit for us?
- Understand the client's vision.
- Agree to the outcomes we're trying to achieve.
- Estimate iterations.
- Sign the contract.
- Pay us for the first iteration.
- Schedule people for iterations.
- We begin work.
